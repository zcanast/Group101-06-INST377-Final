Crime in Prince George's County

The target browsers of our project are commonly used desktop browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).

We used the Prince George's County Crime API: https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/wb4e-w4nf.json

Our project supports a graph of different crime types as well as a map of where the crimes took place.

Our project utilizes Chart.js for the chart and Leaflet for the map.

For our CSS we used Bootstrap V5.2

Our project is trying to show where crimes take place and thier frequency in order for people to make visual inferences about what crimes occur in PG county and where they have happened.
